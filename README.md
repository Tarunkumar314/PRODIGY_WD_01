Project Description: Responsive Landing Page for Prodigy InfoTech
At Prodigy InfoTech, I strive to create web solutions that are not only functional but also visually appealing and user-friendly. My latest project is a responsive landing page designed to showcase my capabilities and provide a seamless user experience across all devices.

Key Features:
Fixed Navigation Menu: The navigation menu is always visible at the top of the page, making it easy for users to navigate between sections.
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring that the page looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Interactive Elements:
Hover Effects: Links in the navigation menu change color when hovered over, enhancing user engagement.
Scroll Effects: The background color of the header changes when the user scrolls down the page, adding a dynamic feel to the browsing experience.
Clear Call-to-Action: The landing page includes a prominent "Learn more" button to guide users towards further interaction.
Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the content of the landing page, including headings, paragraphs, images, and navigation links.
CSS: For styling the page, ensuring a modern and clean design. CSS media queries are used to make the page responsive.
JavaScript: For adding interactivity, such as toggling the mobile menu and changing the header style on scroll.
